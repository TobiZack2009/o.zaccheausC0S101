Mike Adenuga, Chairman/CEO at Globacom Ltd has recently requested you to develop a Rust application that will help management to access the structures of the database schemas of the company. The Rust program should show the structure of the database and all corresponding tables respectively.

The application should consider the following criteria as requested:

•*If the user is an administrator the application returns the database structure.*

•*If the user is a project manager the application returns the structure of the project table.*

•*If the user is an employee the application returns the structure of the staff table.*

•*If the user is a customer the application calls the customer table,*

•*and if the user is a vendor the application returns the data-plan table.*

**Hints:**

•**Use your knowledge of Rust functions.**

•**Commit to your GitHub repository.**
